          <h1>Meet The Owner</h1>
          <p>
            Cliff Dvorak has been the owner of Muleshoe Antiques for 10 years.
            In 2000, he was looking at small towns to settle down with his wife
            after college, when he found Victor. He became inspired by the
            amazing historical architecture, the rich history, and the friendly
            quiet people. He could also fufill his passions for treasure
            hunting. He has been all over the Cripple Creek district searching
            for coins, jewlery, bottles, rusty junk, and much more, for the 24
            years he has lived here. He also has had a field day in colorado
            going to thrift stores, yard and estate sales, trading, buying and
            selling antiques. At a certain point, there was too much stuff, so
            he decided to open up an Antique store across the street in order to
            get rid of some of it.
